# Python Game Project

This project is developed using Python to demonstrate the logic and design of a simple interactive game. It focuses on clear structure, easy gameplay, and beginner-friendly code that helps understand basic programming concepts.

## Features
- Fully developed using Python  
- Simple and interactive gameplay  
- Easy-to-read and modify source code  
- Suitable for beginners learning game logic

## Technologies Used
- Python (Standard Library)  
- Basic control structures and logic implementation  

## How It Works
1. The user starts the game through the main Python file.  
2. Game logic handles scoring, timing, and user input.  
3. Results or game-over messages are displayed based on performance.

## Applications
- Game development learning  
- Python programming practice  
- Educational demonstrations

## Future Enhancements
- Add multiple levels or rounds  
- Include sound effects and animations  
- Improve the scoring and timer system
